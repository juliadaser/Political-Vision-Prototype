    <h1><strong>About the Project</strong></h1>

    <p class="rhetoric-question">
        <i>What if biased algorithms of search engines and news pages are the modern Toxoplasma Parasite - manipulating
            and altering
            our access to different political perspectives for their benefit?</i>
    </p>

    <p class="concept-statement">
        Through an on-body-technology headpiece, <i> Political Vision</i> speculates on a potential dangerous
        relationship between bias of information resources and humans, in which news sources control our access to
        information in order to alter our political viewpoints, actions and emotions.
    </p>

    <p class="more-detail">
        The project is originally inspired by the parasitic relationship between cats and mice. Upon contact with
        toxoplasma parasites through cats, the mouse's brain chemistry is permanently manipulated to make it more
        susceptible to predation by cats - it alters the mouse’s learning ability, its fear and anxiety response as well
        as its dopamine production. A similar phenomenon can be observed in humans called the filter-bubble effect, a
        self-reinforcing pattern
        present in search engines and political newspapers that reduces human’s creativity, learning, and perspectives.
        <!-- A study conducted in 2015
        by Epstein and Robertson found out that election related manipulation of search engine rankings can change a
        user’s voting preference by 20% after a single search. -->
